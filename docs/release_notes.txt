   main image area.

v0.5    Released 24:07:2008

This is the first widely-distributed release (as part of HEALPix 2.1)
Changes from v0.4.2 are minor:

 - Files -> Load FITS now notices the extension number if specified, 
   instead of always using the default (primary HDU if it contains an
   image, otherwise extension 1). 
 - HTML documentation has been revised to remove formatting errors and 
   improve the formatting of maths (a bit).

V0.4.2  Released 03:05:2008

This is a minor bug fix release. Bugs fixed:

 - Corrected typo in HEALPix sentinel values.
 - ximview no longer crashes on startup when !X.style = 1 is set (!)
 - Analysis -> "Set image properties" should now always adjust the correct 
   tab. 
 - Tab labels for polarization tabs no longer revert to "RGB" when another 
   tab is added.
 - The tab selection matrices for RGB and polarization now omit tabs which 
   already carry RGB or polarization images.
 - The marker symbol is now always drawn in the right window and nearly 
   always with the right colour.
 - RGB images now behave "correctly" if the tab containing one of the colour 
   channels is deleted (i.e., that colour vanishes but the program does not 
   crash).


V0.4  Released 30:03:2008

Changes
 - Colour usage:
       * Tabs -> "Red-Green-Blue" allows you make a 3-colour image using 
         images already loaded on other tabs for each colour channel. 
         There are two modes: "Saturate to white" and "Preserve colour for 
         saturated pixels" (the latter based on the SDSS algorithm).
	 See the Help file for details.
       * Tabs -> Polarization -> "Colour" allows you to display polarization
         data using hue-value or hue-saturation-value scaling.
       * Display -> Colour Handling -> "Separate on each tab" is now fully
         enabled. Tabs containing RGB images always operate in this mode.
       * Autoscaling has been tuned for all available colour tables and
         transfer functions.
       * Flashing has been reduced for DirectColor mode on 24-bit displays.
         This mode has the advantage that changes in the colour tables are
         reflected instantly, so you may prefer it if you are doing a lot
         of colour manipulation (but there is still significant flashing).
       * The colour scale bar now lists the units.
       * Colours of scaling histograms have been improved.

   The first two options are only available on 24-bit displays.

 - Ximview (and its PARSE_INPUT routine) now recognizes HEALPix CUT4 
   partial-sky datasets and converts them into partial-sky images in
   the usual HEALPix projections. The cursor readout should correctly
   give sky positions and HEALPix (all-sky) pixel numbers.

 - New option: Display -> "Reset to default screen size" restores the GUI 
   to its initial screen size (512 x 512 pixel image area).

 - New option: File -> "Write PNG" dumps the currently-displayed image
   region to a PNG file.

 - New option: File -> "Load image file" loads an image in any of the
   formats known to IDL. Not very useful since the new image must match
   the size of the images already loaded.

 - If you load data from a directory other than your default directory, 
   ximview remembers and starts in the same directory the next time you
   use File -> "Load FITS". This only affects bulk data: PNG and log files 
   are always written to your default directory (unless you include a path
   in the file name).

 - On the Tabs -> "Blink Setup" dialog, you can now choose to omit the scale
   bar when blinking, as it can be distracting.

 - New option: Analysis -> "Set image properties" allows you to set or 
   reset the polarization and frequency stored for each image. But see 
   Help: "Features and Bugs" for a potential problem with this.

 - Hypertext help is now available, using the IDL Help Assistant in IDL
   version 6.2 and higher. You can also access the files directly with your
   favourite browser: start at docs/home.html in the XIMVIEW directory.

 - All generally-usable routines now have IDL documentation headers.

 - "Load FITS" and "Adjust scaling" dialogs have been made more user-
   friendly.  The former no longer calls the latter if you autoscale on 
   input, but you can now have the autoscale histograms plotted in that 
   case.

 - Default HEALPix sort order changed to "RING", for consistency with other
   HEALPix programs.

 - The Ximview window now pops up right away (still takes a while to load
   large images, though)

Bug fixes: 
 - Request for columns by names now works.
 - Ximview / parse_input can now (again) read multiple columns from HEALPix 
   files which use a repeat count in TFORMn.
 - Ximview now returns to its original size after you maximize the window
   and then unmaximize it, instead of shrinking slightly. Also, no longer 
   jumps to small size if you drag the edge too slowly.
 - Scaling problems for all-zero maps have been fixed.
 - NUMUNIT now works for value = 0.0 and parses units like "mK,thermodynamic"
 - Ximview now works properly when an already-gridded healpix map is loaded
   with the /ROLL option set.
 - HEALPix "Magic number" blanks are now recognised (but are converted to
   NaNs on input).
 - Ximview no longer complains when header items are found in both the
   primary header and the extension header (it uses the latter). Trivial
   duplications within the same extension (as are common in WMAP headers) 
   are now also ignored.


V0.3a Released 28:02:2008

Changes:
 - ximview now can display multiple (aligned) images via a set of tabs, 
   with associated changes, allowing you to:
        * blink between tabs in any desired sequence
        * transfer data to and from the widget after it has been started via 
          a second call to ximview (to) and a new "ximget" function (from).
        * Read a FITS file into the widget.
        * Adjust scaling parameters, including a basic auto-scale function.

 - There is now some choice of colour scale and transfer functions.

 - You can explicit specify set the view centre, via image pixel or 
   coordinates.

 - You can now specify the FITS extension you want.

 - The Peakfit button can now be set to find specifically a maximum, or 
   specifically a minumum, instead of the default behaviour of finding the
   largest extremum in absolute terms.

 - There is now a menu bar at the top of the widget giving access to these 
   features and a few others. Options for Imstats and Peakfits have been
   moved to there instead of the bottom of the window.

   Note: a number of menu options appear but do nothing yet. Consider these
   advertisments for future versions!

 - Documentation: Ximview and Ximget now have standard IDL documentation
   headers, which can be read using the IDL routine DOC_LIBRARY. This file
   and doc/help.txt file can be accessed from Ximview's Help menu via
   "Release notes" and "Help" respectively.

Changes to lower-level routines:
 - PARS_INPUT has been renamed PARSE_INPUT to reduce confusion.
 - The distribution contains more files because some code has been split out 
   of the main ximview.pro file. This will only be compiled when needed, 
   which should slightly reduce startup time on slow systems. There is also
   a more structured directory system (this should not affect usage).

Bug fixes:
 - Bug fixed in PARSE_INPUT that generated unimportant divide-by-zero messages
 - Various bugs fixed in PARSE_INPUT for obscure input types
 - Changes to SCALE_IMAGE to prevent floating-point errors due to conversion
   to bytes of floats outside the range of short integers. (-32768 - 32767).
 - Equivalent change to SET_COLOUR_BAR...but if you have that many wraps the
   colour bar is not much use as it is radically undersampled.
 - Many changes to NUMUNIT to give more sensible results.
 
v0.2.1 Released 31:01:2008

Changes:

 - Bug fixed in PARS_INPUT that prevented reading of on-line images
 - new routine NUMUNIT used by PARS_INPUT for formatting number-unit pairs.

v0.2a Released 29:01:2008

Changes:

 - You can now resize the ximview window to get a bigger or smaller view.
   Occasionally this disables the cursor in the draw window (so tracking 
   data is not updated and clicking has not effect): to restore normal 
   operation, make a small adjustment to the window size.

 - ximview now switches device to WINDOWS or X as appropriate if needed, 
   and sets decomposed = 0. It does this whenever the cursor enters the 
   window, and restores the previous graphics state when the cursor leaves.
   This should cure most of the colour problems that have been reported,
   and allows ximview to work with other IDL graphics programs simultaneously.

 - You can select a column in a multi-column table with COLUMN=col, where col 
   is either a number or the column name. COLUMN=n will also select a plane of 
   a multi-plane image.

 - ximview now produces a log file containing data for marked pixels and 
   outputs from Peakfit and Imstats (these are still printed to the terminal
   as well). By default the file is 'ximview.log' and will be overwritten each 
   time ximview is launched. To give a unique name 'ximview_1.log', 
   'ximview_2.log' etc., set /LOG, or set LOG= to a name of your choice.

 - Regions of interest has been enabled: if you click the Imstats
   button after selecting ROI, a second window pops up allowing you to 
   select various ways of drawing the ROI (uses the built-in IDL routine
   CW_DEFROI). Imstats printout now includes flux density (area-integrated 
   temperature) if the pixel size is known.

 - Initial "overview" is now centred, instead of positioned at the bottom left
   corner of the display window.

 - Initial overview is now zoomed-in if the input map is small. 

 - ximview now starts up slightly to the right of the default starting 
   position on your computer display (top left corner of screen under linux), 
   mainly to avoid covering the ROI widget when that appears.

 - For small images, on entry to zoom mode the zoom factor is set to
   the largest possible value consistent with showing the whole image,
   provided this is >= 1.

 - Panning is disabled if the whole image is on screen.

 - ximview now notices when it reaches the maximum zoom in/out, instead of
   waiting until you try to exceed these limits.

 - pixel readout is updated immediately on zoom or change from overview to 
   zoom mode, instead of waiting for the cursor to move.

 - numerous minor bug fixes.

Changes to lower-level routines:

 - pars_input now reads FITS files containing only a primary HDU.
 - pars_input FITS I/O should generally be faster and require less memory.
 - pars_input also has a COLUMN parameter, which can be an array. In this
   case its output is usually an array of pointers to 2D maps.
 - pars_input is now better at interpreting FITS headers when constructing
   the image title.

 - hpgrid can now accept as input an N-dimensional array of pointers, each 
   referencing a (1D) healpix map array. In this mode, or if it is given a 
   1+N dimensional map, it outputs an N-dimension array of pointers to 
   gridded 2D maps.
 - hpgrid no longer prints timing information, unless you set /VERBOSE

 - wcsxy2sph has been improved so ximview should no longer produce 
   astrometry error messages when ROLL is disabled.

 - imstats now accepts pixel lists and uses the astrometry structure or 
   HEALPix Nside to calculate pixel areas. It reports detection of variable 
   pixel area but only uses a rough average to do the integration.

 - grid2hp_index now has a /BOTH option which returns both RING and NESTED
   pixel numbers.

 - Lower-level routines are now compiled "hidden" so they don't clog up your 
   HELP listings.

 - crashes (if any) should return to the command line ($MAIN$).

 - All IDL Astrolib routines used, that are not included in the HEALPix 
   distribution, are now included in the astrolib subdirectory of this
   distribution. To get the benefit of recent bug fixes, set your path 
   to access this directory before local copies of Astrolib, including 
   the HEALPix subset.

v0.1a: Alpha test version. Released 12:01:2008
