<p>This page explains how to exploit some of the less obvious features of 
ximview.

<h2><a name="EXCHANGE">Data exchange with the command line</a></h2>

<p>If ximview is already running, as well as loading data from files, you
can transfer an image from the IDL command line to a new tab
by simply running ximview again:
<pre>

HIDL> ximview, new_image, range</kbd>

</pre>
<p><kbd>new_image</kbd> can be any of the input options available on 
initial startup, but
since file I/O is most conveniently done by the Load FITS menu option,
this is most useful for on-line data. All the 
<a href="comline.html">command line options</a> are available. However, unless <kbd>/OVERWRITE</kbd> is set, the options specifying the HEALPix projection are ignored, and the projection will conform to that for the images already loaded.

<p>You can also extract an image from ximview with the 
<code><a href="ximget.html">ximget</a></code> function:
<pre>

HIDL> image = ximget('Temp')

</pre>
<p>The argument specifies which tab to extract. 
It is therefore possible to load images into Ximview, examine them,
extract them to the command line and perform further processing (e.g.
take the difference, extract a dipole, etc), and re-display the result
without the overheads of file I/O and conversion from pixel list to
grid.</p>

<h2><a name="SLICE">Slices of multi-dimensional images</A></H2>
<p>If your dataset is an image with more than two dimensions, you can 
load a subset of the image slices using the 
<KBD><a href="comline.html#COLUMN" target="frame2">COLUMN</A></KBD> keyword on
the command line, or the equivalent "Columns/Slices" box in the 
<b><a href="menu.html#FITSLOAD" target="frame2">Load FITS</a></b> dialog box.

<p>The numbering starts from 1 for the first slice (i.e. FITS-style rather than
IDL-style), and all dimensions higher than 2 are collapsed into a
single third dimension. For instance, if your third and fourth dimensions 
are STOKES (planes 1 to 4 representing I,Q,U,V) and FREQUENCY (100 channels),
then slices 40, 41, 42 would pick up Stokes V for frequency channel 10, 
and Stokes I and Q for frequency channel 11.

<p>Ximview selects slices from multi-dimensional arrays of HEALPix datasets 
in a similar
way; the only difference is that dimensions higher than 1 are collapsed, since
a HEALPix "map" is stored in a one-dimensional array.

<h2><a name="ALIGN">Image alignment</A></h2>

<p>Ximview keeps all images aligned, so that when swapping between tabs,
the same region is displayed in each case. This is only possible if
the images are all the same size, and if they have coordinate
information it must be consistent. All images loaded after the initial
set-up, via <b>Load FITS</b> or <b>Load image file</b> on
the <a href="menu.html#FILE">file menu</a> or via 
<a href="exchange.html">running ximview again</a>, 
are checked for agreement and will be rejected if there is a
serious disagreement. Warnings are issued if the coordinates disagrees
in that one or other image does not have coordinates properly set
(including astrometry keywords for astronomical images). <b>Exception:</b> if only one tab is displayed, it can be replaced with all these checks ignored if <kbd>/OVERWRITE</kbd> is set on the command line.</p>

<h2><a name="PROJ">HEALPix Projections</a></h2>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>HEALPix is not an image format but a way of precisely 
describing a pattern of equal-area pixels on the sphere, with the
pixel size defined by the N<sub>side</sub> parameter (valid values are
any power of two), with a total of 12 N<sub>side</sub><sup>2</sup> pixels
over the whole sphere. HEALPix data is stored as a one-dimensional list
of pixel values, usually in a FITS binary table extension. For display
purposes the pixel values are interpolated or binned into some projection
of the sky onto a plane, most commonly the Mollweide projection, as shown
at right.</p>
<div class="spacer"> </div>
<div class="figure">

	  width="394" height="419">
  <p>All-sky map displayed in the Healpix grid projection. 
</div>
<p>Ximview uses one of two related projections that turn
the diamond-shaped HEALPix pixels into squares, so that they can be 
mapped one-to-one
onto the display pixels. The default, "GRID", is the HEALPix projection 
defined by 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.381..865C" target="_TOP">
Calabretta & Roukema (2007)</a>, which has FITS World Coordinate System 
code 'HPX'. This is a 5 &times; N<sub>side</sub> square grid with the 
zero of latitude running diagonally from top-right to bottom-left. 
When data is loaded in this
format, you can pan seamlessly around the sky: moving through the top-right
of the map automatically brings you back to the bottom left. This projection
is relatively inefficient in data storage: of the 25 squares only 13 are
occupied and this includes one that is duplicated at top right and bottom
left. This is the default HEALPix projection for ximview.</p>

  <p>All-sky map displayed in the Healpix butterfly projection.
The square shows a 512 &times; 512 pixel field of view.
</div>
<p>You can also choose the "butterfly" projections invented by Stuart Lowe
and mentioned in the same paper, and described more fully in a note
by <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/XPH.pdf"  
      class="pdf" target="_TOP">Calabretta & Lowe (2013)</a> (70 kB). 
These have WCS code 'XPH', and occupy a 4 &times; N<sub>side</sub> 
square centred on a pole. Select with "NPOLE" for the north pole and
"SPOLE" for the south pole. The grid and butterfly projections differ 
only in that the four quadrants are rearranged. The butterfly projection is
more efficient for data storage as 3/4 of the area is occupied by sky pixels,
with no repeats. This will be important if your image sizes approach the 
available memory in IDL.</p>

<h2><a name="LOG">Log file</A></h2>

<p>Ximview always tries to produce a text logfile containing
<ul>
<li>Program start time
<li>Very basic header info for the data
<li>Pixel data produced by clicking the middle mouse button
<li>Output produced by Imstats and Peakfit.
</ul>
<p>By default the file is <kbd>ximview.log</kbd> and is overwritten each time
ximview is run. The name can be specified by the <kbd>LOG</kbd> keyword on the
command line or the <b>New logfile</b> option on the 
<a href="menu.html#FILE" target="frame2">File menu</a>.
If you do not have write access to the directory in which you are running
ximview, it issues a warning message but carries on without writing the 
logfile.</p>


<P>As well as providing a convenient record of the numerical results
produced by Ximview, if one has marked a series of points their coordinates
can be read back into IDL for further plotting and processing. It is first
necessary to close the log file to flush the output buffer, which can be
done by starting a new logfile from the file menu. The file can then be
read with <code>READCOL</code> from the IDL Astrolib:
<pre>

HIDL> READCOL, 'ximview.log', x, y, long, lat, flux, zoom

</pre>
<p>This reads the coordinates into the arrays, x, y etc
(choose your arguments to match the values listed by ximview, which
vary in number depending the dataset, e.g. HEALPix or not). 
<code>READCOL</code> is smart enough to ignore
the introductory lines in the logfile automatically, as long as there are
some lines to read with the correct number of numerical values.
 
<H2><a name="CRASH">Crash recovery</A></H2>

<p>Ximview is now pretty stable, but in the unlikely event that it 
crashes without properly exiting, 
I recommend the following: 

<p>If the program stopped in module <code>XIMVIEW</code>, 
(you must have been running in debug mode, i.e. with <kbd>/VERBOSE</kbd> set),
then before typing <kbd>RETALL</kbd> or <kbd>RETURN</kbd>, try the following:
<pre>

HIDL> error_status = 1
HIDL> GOTO, BAIL

</pre>
<p>Otherwise, if the program returns to <code>MAIN</code> 
(i.e. the command line), then 
<pre>

HIDL> gscroll_tidy  ; Deletes invisible (PIXMAP) windows.<BR>
HIDL> heap_gc       ; Deletes any orphaned heap variables.
HIDL> close, /all   ; If the crash happened while reading a file

</pre>
