<H1>Gripes and FAQs for Ximview</H1>

<h4><a name="READOUT">My cursor is well outside the image, but the readout
is still listing valid fluxes</a></h4>
<p>This is more of a feature than a bug.  When the cursor is positioned 
outside the image, the position reported is the nearest pixel on the edge of 
the image. Let me know if this <strong>really</strong> bothers you. Notice
that when the cursor is in the image, but within a 'gore', i.e. a gap in
the map projection, ximview correctly reports 'no sky pixel'.</p>

<h4><a name="SQUARES">I'm trying to scroll but the image is a jumble of
mismatched square panels</a></h4>
<p>This is what you get when you push ximview with some combination of 
a very large image and a slow client-server connection. Then ximview may 
not finish updating the view before returning, so you see the underlying
workings which are usually hidden. The mismatched panels will be 
progressively filled in with correct data when you pan the
view (slowly!) a bit more, and/or simply wait for a few seconds.</p>

<h4><a name="HAND">I notice that the cursor briefly changes into
a hand icon when I finish dragging. Why is that?</a></h4>
<p>This is a Microsoft Windows peculiarity. You are supposed to get the 
gripping hand cursor when you drag, but under Windows the cursor is not
updated until you release the mouse button&hellip;at which point 
dragging has stopped, of course. I would be grateful if someone could
tell me a workaround.</p>

<h4><a name="STOPPED">Ximview launches but then hangs / Ximview has suddenly frozen!</a></h4>
<P>You are probably in a stopped procedure. That is, you ran an IDL 
procedure which crashed or hit a "STOP" statement, and did not re-start it 
with the .continue command, or return to the top level by typing 
RETURN or RETALL. 
In this state, IDL widgets including ximview do not accept any "events", e.g. 
button clicks. If you start ximview in this state it launches and then hangs. 
If you have already started it and then run a script that stops, ximview hangs.
To fix, return to the main level by typing RETALL or RETURN or .continue as
appropriate.</p>

<h4><a name="TRUECOLOR">My images are all greyscale!</a></h4>
<p>This can happen under linux if your visual class is not set to
TrueColor. To fix,  at IDL startup, before running Ximview or any other 
graphics applications, set:
<pre>

HIDL> DEVICE, TRUE=24

</pre>
This is now the default, but for IDL v6 and earlier the default was 
DirectColor. Ximview originally made some attempt to work with DirectColor, 
although this reassigns the colours for every element on your screen when
the cursor is in the Ximview window. This no longer works, but if you really 
want to run Ximview with DirectColor, try commenting out the call
to <code>TVLCT</code> in <tt>utilities/restore_lut.pro</tt> in the ximview
directory, and let me know what happens (this will tend to overwrite 
any colour schemes you are trying to set outside of ximview). 
Similar remarks apply to the even older PseudoColor visual.

<h4><a name="FONTS">Ximview's terminal output formatting is terrible!</a></h4>
<p>It looks really bad if your output window uses a variable width font,
which was the default for IDL v6 under Microsoft windows. I suggest you change 
to a fixed-width font, e.g. via File -> Preferences. (This also makes IDL's own 
error messages more comprehensible).</p>

<h4><a name="PROJECTION">When will Ximview allow me to change the projection
of the map?</a></h4>
<p>Never. Ximview is designed to allow you to inspect
the map "as is", so it strictly adheres to the policy that one image
pixel corresponds to one displayed pixel (or one square of displayed pixels
if zoomed-in). That is why it uses the apparently-awkward "HEALPix" 
projections for HEALPix datasets.

<h4><a name="CUBES">Ximview is not good at handling cubes with more
than a handful of channels, can't you do better?</a></h4>
<p>A ds9-like frequency slider for spectral cubes is on the wish list,
but don't hold your breath.
<h4><a name="GDL">When will Ximview run under <a href="https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl">GDL</a>?</h4>
<p>Real soon now. Currently the GDL widget routines can't quite handle Ximview but this may change within months.
