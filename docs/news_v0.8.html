<H1><a name="WHATSNEW">What's New in Ximview 0.8</a></H1>

<p>This release features some significant improvements in usability
through both new features and better default behaviour. A substantial number
of bugs have been fixed. This remains a beta release, so please send
me bug reports, complaints about unsatisfactory features, and requests for
new features.

<p><a name="HIGHLIGHTS">Highlights</a> include
<ul>
<li> Ximview can now be launched without specifying an input dataset, so
the GUI <a href="menu.html#FILE" target="frame2">file chooser</a> can be 
used to find the file you want.
<li> You can zoom in and out using the scroll wheel on your mouse.
<li> FITS and TIFF headers of datasets can be 
<a href="menu.html#HEADERS" target="frame2">displayed</a>, and can be returned
to the IDL command line by <a href="ximget.html" target="frame2">ximget</a>.
<li> Ximview now <a href="lutran.html#AUTO" target="frame2">auto-scales</a> 
input datasets by default.
<li> Colour tables are now independent for each tab, although it is easy
to choose a uniform colour table and transfer function for all tabs.
<li> Precisions of positions and image intensities reported by Ximview,
<a href="intro.html#PEAKFIT" target="frame2">Peakfit</a> and 
<a href="intro.html#IMSTATS" target="frame2">Imstats</a> are
now chosen appropriately for the image resolution and dynamic range.
<li> Right Ascension and Declination are reported in sexagesimal form;
other coordinate systems are still reported in degrees.
<li> If a new image is loaded which has no astrometric metadata (e.g. a 
simple data array from the command line), it is now
assumed to be properly aligned with the existing images, providing it matches
in terms of pixel dimensions. Similarly, if
the first image loaded lacked astrometry, a later image with astrometry
will be assumed to define the coordinate system. If astrometry is specified
in more than one dataset, they still must agree.
<li> Tab labelling has been improved.
<li> This help system has been updated.
<li> <b><a href="menu.html#PNG" target="frame2">Write PNG Image</a></b> now 
gives you the option to leave out the scale bar.
<li> New <KBD>/STRUCTURE</KBD> and <KBD>/POINTER</KBD> options for
<code><a href="ximget.html" target="frame2">ximget</a></code>.
<li><a href="intro.html#IMSTATS" target="frame2">Imstats</a> 
output format has been improved.
</ul>

<p><a name="BUGFIX">Major bug fixes</a>:
<ul>
<li> Ximview now properly selects columns from IDL structures and reads
extensions in FITS files which have an image in the primary HDU.
<li> Autoscale should now work sensibly on any input, including 
integer and byte values and featureless (flat) images.
<li> Fluxes and intensities reported by Imstats and Peakfit are now correct;
formerly they were sometimes in error by powers of 1000.
<li> The graphics state is now fully insulated from the command line, so
changing the graphics system variables <KBD>!P, !X, !Y</KBD> no longer affects
the display of scale bar labels etc. This has fixed a problem under Windows
where plots intended for the normal IDL plot window sometimes appeared on 
the Ximview screen instead.
<li> The Red-Black-Blue colour scale now always aligns black with 
effective zero intensity as intended: formerly this only worked if the 
image was explicitly re-scaled.
<li> Various bugs in the unit parser have been fixed and it now has a more
thorough go at putting whatever units are found in the FITS header into
standard form.
<li> Closing popup windows via the window manager no longer generates (usually
harmless) error messages, but is equivalent to choosing "Cancel".
<li> If on-line HEALPix data is supplied in any form (plain
array, structure, or pointer), bad pixel sentinel values are no longer
converted to NaNs in the original arrays (unless <KBD>/TEMPORARY</KBD> is
set, in which case the data may well not be returned at all).
</ul>

<p>Ximview still lacks a few planned features, so the release number
is still less than 1.0. The most obvious of these is the ability to overlay
coordinate grids. Don't expect this anytime soon.
