<p>Astronomical images usually have large dynamic range, so a simple scaling,
where the faintest pixel is black and the brightest white, will leave the vast
majority of pixels indistinguishable from black. We increase the contrast both
by using pseudo-colour look-up table (LUT) to get finer discrimination 
between nearby intensity levels
levels, and also by using a non-linear trasfer function between intensity
and bytes. <strong>Note</strong> the numerical values of intensity reported
by ximview are from the original image, unaffected by LUT or transfer 
function.

<h2><a name="TRANS">Transfer functions</a></h2>

<p>In the first step, the original image data is scaled into [0, 255]
via a "transfer function", then these values are interpreted as
colours via the colour table.

<p>Ximview currently supports the following transfer functions:
<dl>
<dt>Linear</dt>
<dd>Output proportional to <i>(intensity &minus; min)</i>.
<p> Here and below, <i>min</i> is the 
minimum in the requested 
<KBD><a href="comline.html#RANGE" target="frame2">range</a></KBD> (which
defaults to the data minimum).
</dd>
<dt>Sqrt</dt><dd>   Output proportional to 
&radic;(<i>intensity &minus; min</i>), or zero if argument is negative.
</dd>
<dt>Asinh</dt><dd>  Output proportional to
<blockquote>
Asinh<i>((intensity &minus; zero) / &beta;)</i> 
&minus; <i>Asinh((min &minus; zero) / &beta;)</i>.
</blockquote>
<i>Zero</i> and <i>&beta;</i> can be set via the 
<a href="menu.html#ADJUST">Adjust Scaling</a> dialog on the 
<a href="menu.html#DISPLAY">display menu</a>, 
or by <a href="autoscale.html">auto-scaling</a>.  
This gives linear scaling for 
<i>|intensity| &lt;&lt; &beta;</i>, and logarithmic for 
<i>|intensity| &gt;&gt; &beta;</i>. 
Choosing &beta; a few times the noise gives good results. Prior to 
autoscaling, the default &beta; is 1 unit, which probably won't work.

</dd><dt>Hist Eq</dt><dd>(Histogram equalization). 
Output is an irregular mapping of the 
          intensities between range min and range max, chosen to give equal 
          number of pixels per increment of the output scale.
</dd></dl>

<p>Asinh scaling is strongly recommended for high dynamic-range images.

<p>The byte scaling of data outside the requested input range of intensities
is controlled by the 
<KBD><a href="comline.html#WRAP" target="frame2">WRAP</a></KBD>
parameter.

<h2><a name="AUTO">Auto-scaling</a></h2>

<p>The auto-scaling algorithm aims to scale the image so that
"noise-like" fluctuations around the zero level are visible but don't
use up too much of the colour scale, so that bright features are
visible rather than being completely saturated. The results depend on
the current <a href="menu.html#COLTAB" target="frame2">colour table</a> and 
<a href="#TRANS">transfer function</a>.

<p>It works in two stages:

<h3>Stage 1: Robust estimate of image rms and mode</h3>

<p>This stage may be quite time-consuming for large images, but its
results are permanently recorded so it is not repeated if you need to
re-run auto-scale.

<p>Floating-point Not-a-Number (NaNs) and infinities are rejected as bad
data.  If more than 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> of the pixels are exactly zero, it is
assumed that zero also marks bad data and these are rejected.

<p>A first guess is made by finding the rms and mean of the good
data. These are used to choose bins for a histogram, covering &plusmn; 2&sigma;
around the mean, with enough points in each bin to make random
fluctuations unlikely to change the mode. If the modal bin falls in
the outer 20% of the histogram, the histogram is re-made with finer
bins, centred on the mode, and this is iterated if necessary.

<p>The final mode is found by a quadratic fit to the five bins centred on
the histogram peak. This is our estimate of the true zero level. The
noise estimate is the one-sided rms below the mode if the mode is lower than
the mean (as it usually is), and above the mode if the mode is higher than 
the mean, indicating significant features at negative intensities. (Perfectly
legitimate for images of quantities like Stokes Q or U).</p>

<p>On request, the histogram and quadratic fit will be plotted in a pop-up 
window if you run auto-scale from the 
<a href="menu.html#FILE" target="frame2">Load FITS</a> or 
<a href="menu.html#ADJUST" target="frame2">Adjust scaling</a> 
dialogs.  For large HEALPix images it is quicker to
run auto-scale when the data is first loaded, because then there is no
need to process the large number of "off-sky" pixels which pad out the
2-D projected image.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> This algorithm will fail if the histogram is 
montonically decreasing, e.g. as often occurs in Maximum Entropy (MEM) images.


<h3>Stage 2: Choose the range, zero and beta</h3>

<p>The estimated zero level is set to the mode. The beta parameter for
Asinh scaling is set to 2&sigma; (1.5&sigma; for the red-black-blue colour 
table).

<p>The image is classified as positive, negative or neutral according to
whether <i>(max &minus; mode) / (mode &minus; min)</i> is &gt; 5, &lt; 0.2, 
or in between. If
neutral, the scale is set symmetrically around the mode; if positive
it runs from <i>mode &minus; 3&sigma;</i> to a large positive value, 
and vice-versa
for negative images.  The scale is truncated at the actual minimum and
maximum if this prescription exceeds them. The total range is
chosen according to the colour table and transfer function in use.
For linear scaling it varies from 50&sigma; for the
very contrasty "Cyclic" scale to 18&sigma; for the "Red-black-blue"
scale. The ranges are 
squared for the Sqrt function, and the whole data range is used for
Asinh. Histogram equalization uses a nominal range of 400&sigma;.

<h2><a name="PRESER">"Preserve Colour" Option</a></h2>

<p>The RGB dialog gives you the option of using the algorithm of 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..133L" 
target="_TOP">Lupton et al. (2004, PASP, 116, 816)</a> 
to re-scale the input images to preserve
"true" colour. With this set, the colour displayed represents the 
<i>linear</i> ratios of the input channels, prior to any 
<a href="transfun.html">transfer function</a>
scaling. When this option is chosen a second dialog box prompts you to
choose <b>rescale factors</b> for the three channels and a <b>display range</b>
and <b>transfer function</b> for the average image. This works as follows:

<p>Let <i>T<sub>i</sub></i> be the intensity in colour channel <i>i</i>, 
<i>z<sub>i</sub></i> be the zero level
recorded for that channel 
(via the <a href="menu.html#ADJUST">Adjust Scaling</a> dialog), 
<i>A<sub>i</sub></i> be its rescale factor, and <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, 
<i>r<sub>2</sub></i> be the minimum and maximum
of the display range set for the average image. We calculate
<ol>
<li><i> T<sup>c</sup><sub>i</sub>  = A<sub>i</sub> &times; 
(T<sub>i</sub>&minus; z<sub>i</sub>)</i><BR>
(corrected channel image)

<p><i>A<sub>i</sub></i> can compensate for different units on different 
channels or just rescale channels to get a more interesting-looking result.

<li> <i>T<sub>Av</sub> = (1 / N<sub>i</sub>)
</i>&sum;<i><sub>i</sub></i>( <i>T<sup>c</sup><sub>i</sub></i>)<BR>
(Average over colour channels)

<li> <i>F<sub>Av</sub></i> = TransferFunction(<i>T<sub>Av</sub>, 
r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub></i>)<BR>
(Transformed average image, mapping <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> to zero and 
<i>r<sub>2</sub></i> to maximum brightness).

<li> <i>F<sub>i</sub> = (T<sup>c</sup><sub>i</sub> &minus; r<sub>1</sub>) 
&times; (F<sub>Av</sub>/ T<sub>Av</sub>)</i><BR>
(Transformed channel image)
</ol>
<p><i>F<sub>i</sub></i> are used as the colour channels for the R-G-B image. 
They also replace the displayed images on the original tabs (and look very
odd). The point is that the <i>F<sub>i</sub></i> have essentially the same 
ratio as
<i>T<sup>c</sup><sub>i</sub></i> (exactly so, if <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> = 0), 
despite the possibly non-linear scaling of the total intensity.  
Even when <i>F<sub>Av</sub></i> is saturated at the maximum
value, the <i>F<sub>i</sub></i> preserve the "true" colour. 

<p>Note: the overall scale is adjusted so that the maximum 
<i>F<sub>i</sub></i> over all channels is equal to the
maximum colour intensity (255). This tends to give rather dim images
compared to the alternative, the "saturate to white" option.

<p>The grey levels encoding off-sky and bad pixels are also preserved
(bad pixels in any channel make that pixel bad in all channels).

<p>The original tabs can be restored via the "Adjust scaling" dialog, but
then the RGB image will revert to the standard "saturate to white".
