Ximview Installation Instructions

To run Ximview you need:

1. IDL, a commercial package available from NV5 Geospatial: 
   see https://www.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/Products/IDL
   Almost all Ximview code is compatible with IDL v6.0 and later; however
   the aperture photometry routine requires v8.0 or later.

   GDL, a free clone of IDL is being developed: see 
   https://gnudatalanguage.github.io/index.html, but is not quite ready to run 
   Ximview.

2. The HEALPix IDL library. This is available under the GNU Public License
   as part of the HEALPix software collection, see:
   http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml.

   Only the programs in the src/idl/ subdirectory of the HEALPix installation
   are required.

3. The IDLAstro library, formerly maintained by Goddard Space Flight Centre, 
   now at https://github.com/wlandsman/IDLAstro

4. Coyote library http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php
   (in fact only the routine cgERRORMSG is needed, which is called by some 
   IDLAstro routines; but a decent IDL installation will include the full 
   Coyote library) 	

No compilation is necessary, you only have to ensure that the XIMVIEW,
HEALPix, IDLAstro, and Coyote directories are included in your IDL path, 
ideally with XIMVIEW occurring first.
