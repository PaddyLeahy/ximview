XIMVIEW Version 0.9.1 beta

The subdirectories in this folder contain the IDL source code for the ximview
image viewer utility.

See docs/help.txt for a text-based help file, or link to docs/ximview.html
for a web-help system.

See docs/about.txt for credits.

See install.txt in this directory for installation instructions.

XIMVIEW and associated routines use IDL language features introduced in
Version 6.0, and should run under any later version.

               over the image
ximget.pro     Retrieves one of the displayed images as a 2D array
ximgo.pro      Sets the view centre to a desired position

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
core/

ximview.pro         main program and many subroutines, mostly event handlers
make_ximview.pro:   constructs the ximview widget
parse_input.pro     interprets the ximview input data, which can be in many 
                    formats
scale_image.pro     scales image into bytes for display
scaling_params.pro  Estimate image mode and standard deviation

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
docs/
Contains the files for the ximview help system, in both html and text format.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
event_handlers/
contains some of the larger event handlers for ximview, extracted from the 
main program file to allow easier editing.

ximview_blink.pro    Sets up and controls blinking between tabs
ximview_fitsload.pro Loads fits files interactively
ximview_imstats.pro  sets parameters for imstats.pro, and feeds data to it

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
gscroll/
contains the subroutines of the GSCROLL package, which
handles the low-level I/O to the TV including panning and zooming.

Most of these routines access the GRID_GSCROLL common block.

Mid-level: Called directly from high-level routines:

gscroll.pro           Main gscroll routine
gscroll_setup.pro     Initializes GRID_GSCROLL common and creates pixmaps.
gscroll_tidy.pro      Marks common as closed and deletes pixmaps
gscroll_addscreen.pro Updates common for a new screen and creates a pixmap 
                      for it.
gscroll_newscreen.pro Changes from one screen to a new one. Also deletes
                      pixmaps if the former screen has been deleted.
gscroll_refresh.pro   Refreshes the current screen without panning or zooming.
gscroll_setpar.pro    Sets some parameters in GRID_GSCROLL.
gscroll_roi.pro       Supposed to draw a region-of-interest overlay over the
                      current view (not fully debugged)
                 
Low-level: only called by above routines:

gscroll_find_panel.pro
gscroll_load.pro
cellindex.pro

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
hpx/

pixel list datasets and HEALPix grid images.

hpx2hp_array.pro   Converts gridded image to pixel list
hpx2hp.pro         As grid2hp_index, for "GRID" (= HPX) projection only
set_xy_nest.pro    Utility used in pixel coordinate conversion
set_xy_ring.pro    Utility used in pixel coordinate conversion
set_hpi_nest.pro   Utility used in pixel coordinate conversion
set_hpi_ring.pro   Utility used in pixel coordinate conversion
set_ring_offsets   Calculates offset of start of each ring in "RING"
                   ordered pixel lists.
xph2hp.pro         As grid2hp_index, for "NPOLE" or "SPOLE" (=XPH) projections

		    one (including colour tables)
string2coord.pro    Converts a string in many formats to a coordinate angle in 
                    degrees
